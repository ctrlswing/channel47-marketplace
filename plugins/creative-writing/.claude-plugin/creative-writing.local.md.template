# My Writing Preferences

This is a template for customizing the creative-writing plugin. Copy this file to `.claude/creative-writing.local.md` to activate your custom settings.

## Configuration Options

**preferred_tone**: Set your default tone (conversational, formal, authoritative, humble, technical, accessible)

**target_audience**: Define your primary audience (general, technical peers, executives, customers, etc.)

**content_types**: List the types of content you typically write (blog posts, technical writing, essays, emails, documentation, marketing, etc.)

**custom_style_guide**: Point to your own style guide file, or leave as `null` to use the default guide

## Custom Style Guide

If you want to use a completely custom style guide instead of the default:

1. Create your style guide file (e.g., `docs/my-style-guide.md`)
2. Set `custom_style_guide: docs/my-style-guide.md` in the frontmatter above
3. All skills will use your custom guide by default

You can still override this per-skill using the `--style-guide <path>` parameter.

## Supplemental Guidance

Add any additional style notes below this section. These will supplement (not replace) your chosen style guide.
