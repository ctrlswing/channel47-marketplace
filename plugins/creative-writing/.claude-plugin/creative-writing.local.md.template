# My Writing Preferences

Use this file to customize how the creative-writing plugin works.

## How to Use

1. Copy this template to `.claude/creative-writing.local.md`
2. Edit the YAML frontmatter above with your preferences
3. Optionally add notes below for additional guidance

## Custom Style Guides

To use your own style guide:

1. Create a markdown file (e.g., `docs/my-style-guide.md`)
2. Set `custom_style_guide: docs/my-style-guide.md` above
3. All skills will use your guide by default

You can still override with `--style-guide` for one-off tasks.

## Additional Notes

Add any extra guidance here. This content supplements the style guide.
