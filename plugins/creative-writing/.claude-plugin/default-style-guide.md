# Default Writing Style Guide

## Voice Principles

**Lead with honesty, not authority**
Open with something real. Vulnerability or admission works better than declaration.

> Good: "I've spent an embarrassing amount of time wiring together skills and subagents."
> Avoid: "As a power user and expert in AI tooling, I'm excited to share my insights."

**Show your reasoning**
Don't just state conclusions. Walk the reader through what changed your mind.

> Good: "Here's the thing that pushed me over the edge on this approach. I'd been considering a hosted solution. Then I listened to..."
> Avoid: "Plugins are clearly the superior choice for security reasons."

**Acknowledge trade-offs**
Nothing is perfect. Saying so builds trust.

> Good: "The trade-off is that Anthropic doesn't audit third-party plugins, so users have to trust where they're installing from. But that feels manageable compared to the alternative."
> Avoid: "This approach solves all security concerns."

## Structure Guidelines

**Vary sentence length**
Mix short punches with longer explanations. Short sentences land ideas. Longer ones develop them.

**Use natural paragraph breaks**
One idea per paragraph. Let white space organize, not headers or bullet points.

**Favor prose over bullet points**
Incorporate items into narrative. Lists break flow and signal AI-generated content.

> Good: "A single command in the CLI installs everything. Marketplaces can push updates, and users pull them without reinstalling manually."
> Avoid:
> - Easy installation via CLI
> - Automatic updates
> - No manual reinstallation

## Word Choice Standards

**Prioritize concrete details**
Ground abstract concepts with specific, tangible examples.

> Good: "If you've ever tried to get a non-technical teammate to clone a repo, edit a config file, and restart their terminal, you understand why this is a big deal."
> Avoid: "This significantly reduces friction in the onboarding process."

**Simple metaphors that clarify**
Analogies should illuminate, not impress.

> Good: "Those individual pieces are just ingredients. Plugins let you bake the whole cake and hand someone a slice."
> Avoid: "Plugins are the symphony conductor orchestrating a harmonious ensemble of capabilities."

**Conversational asides are allowed**
Small, informal phrases add warmth without derailing.

> Good: "Read-only MCP server, custom skills for the tedious tasks I do constantly. Excluding search terms, adjusting device bids, that sort of thing."

## Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Em-dashes and colons | Overused in AI writing; feels mechanical |
| Hype words ("game-changer," "revolutionary") | Empty claims readers skip |
| Rhetorical questions as transitions | "But what does this mean?" feels manipulative |
| Generic CTAs | "What do you think?" is lazy |
| Opening with bold declarations | Feels performative; earn conclusions |
| Headers every 2-3 paragraphs | Disrupts narrative flow |

## Endings

Close with genuine curiosity, not a sales pitch. Ask specific questions that invite real responses.

> Good: "I'm curious if anyone else is thinking along these lines. Are you building plugins for yourself, or does the idea of running your own little marketplace appeal to you?"
> Avoid: "What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments below!"

## Quick Reference Checklist

When reviewing a draft:

1. Does the opening feel honest or performative?
2. Am I telling the reader what to think, or showing them how I got there?
3. Are there any lists that could be prose?
4. Did I acknowledge a real trade-off or limitation?
5. Is my ending a genuine question or a formality?
6. Could I cut any sentence without losing meaning?
