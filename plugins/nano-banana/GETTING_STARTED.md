## Tips for Better Results

### Prompt Engineering

3. **Specify Context**: Mention time of day, location, atmosphere
4. **Reference Styles**: Mention art styles, photographers, or techniques

### Example Prompts

**Good:**
```
"A cozy coffee shop interior at golden hour, warm lighting streaming through
large windows, exposed brick walls, wooden tables with steaming cups,
potted plants, photorealistic style"
```

**Better:**
```
"Professional commercial photography of a modern coffee shop interior,
shot during golden hour with warm natural lighting streaming through
floor-to-ceiling windows, featuring exposed brick walls, reclaimed wood
tables, artisanal coffee cups with steam, lush green potted plants,
shallow depth of field, 4K quality"
```
