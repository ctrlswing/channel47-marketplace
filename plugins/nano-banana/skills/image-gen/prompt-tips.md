# Prompt Engineering Tips for Nano Banana Pro

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Specific and Descriptive
- Vague prompts produce unpredictable results
- Include concrete details about every important element
- Describe what you want, not what you don't want

### 2. Structure Your Prompt

**Recommended Order:**
1. Main subject
2. Action or pose (if applicable)
3. Setting/environment
4. Lighting conditions
5. Style/medium
6. Mood/atmosphere
7. Technical details (camera, lens, etc.)

### 3. Use Powerful Modifiers

**Quality Modifiers:**
- "highly detailed", "intricate", "sharp focus"
- "8K resolution", "professional quality"
- "award-winning", "masterpiece"

**Lighting Modifiers:**
- "golden hour", "soft diffused light", "dramatic lighting"
- "rim lighting", "backlit", "studio lighting"
- "natural light", "candlelight", "neon glow"

**Style Modifiers:**
- "photorealistic", "hyperrealistic"
- "cinematic", "editorial", "fashion photography"
- "digital art", "concept art", "matte painting"
- "oil painting", "watercolor", "pencil sketch"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't:

## Grounding-Specific Tips

When using Google Search grounding for accuracy:

1. **Real Locations**: Use exact names, mention "accurate architectural details"
2. **Famous People**: Include context, time period, and setting
3. **Historical Events**: Specify era, location, and key elements
4. **Scientific Subjects**: Use technical terminology, request accuracy

Example with grounding:
```
"Accurate photorealistic image of the Sydney Opera House at sunset,
viewed from Circular Quay, warm golden light reflecting on harbor water,
architectural details faithful to the real structure,
professional photography, 4K quality"
```
