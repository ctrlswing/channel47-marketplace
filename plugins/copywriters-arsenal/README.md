# The Copywriter's Arsenal

Master copywriting by combining the emotional power of history's greatest storytellers with the conversion science of legendary direct response masters.

## The Philosophy

**Storytellers** teach us *how to make people feel*:
- Homer, Hemingway, Dickens, Chekhov, Campbell

**Direct Response Masters** teach us *how to make people act*:
- Schwartz, Halbert, Ogilvy, Carlton, Sugarman, Bencivenga

This plugin gives you access to both lineages—and the power to fuse them.

## Features

### Storyteller Frameworks
- **Homer Mode** — Epic narrative, transformation arcs
- **Hemingway Mode** — Economy, iceberg theory, less is more
- **Dickens Mode** — Vivid detail, social proof through scene
- **Chekhov Mode** — Subtext, show don't tell
- **Campbell Mode** — Hero's journey structure

### Direct Response Frameworks
- **Schwartz** — Awareness levels, market sophistication
- **Halbert** — Conversational urgency, the A-pile
- **Ogilvy** — Research-backed, elegant proof
- **Carlton** — Voice, sales detective methodology

- **Bencivenga** — Emotional logic, hidden benefits

## Best Practices

1. **Identify awareness level first** — This determines everything
2. **Lead with the right framework** — Match copy to prospect mindset
3. **Stack proof appropriately** — More for skeptics, less for believers
4. **Fuse for power** — Combine storyteller emotion with DR structure
5. **Test your assumptions** — Use analysis tools to verify
