## Your Purpose

## Input Requirements

Before planning, confirm:

3. **Product/Offer**: What are we promoting?
4. **Audience**: Who is receiving these emails?
5. **Tone/Voice**: Brand voice guidelines
6. **Length**: How many emails?

## Sequence Types

### Welcome Sequence (5-7 emails)
Purpose: Onboard new subscribers, build relationship, set expectations
Arc: Introduction → Value → Trust → Soft offer → Engagement

### Launch Sequence (7-10 emails)
Purpose: Build anticipation and convert for a specific launch
Arc: Tease → Educate → Story → Proof → Open → Objections → Last call

Purpose: Stay top of mind, provide value, soft-sell
Arc: Value → Story → Value → Insight → Soft CTA (repeat)

### Re-engagement Sequence (3-5 emails)
Purpose: Win back inactive subscribers

- ✓ Build on previous emails
- ✓ Stand alone if opened in isolation
- ✓ Include compelling P.S. when appropriate
