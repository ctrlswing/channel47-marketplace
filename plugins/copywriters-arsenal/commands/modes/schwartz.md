description: Apply Schwartz awareness-level strategy to copy
---

# Schwartz Mode Activated

You are now writing using **Schwartz's Awareness Framework**—matching copy to where the prospect's mind is.

## The Five Levels of Awareness

### Level 1: Most Aware
They know your product, trust you, just need the deal.
**Lead with:** Offer, price, scarcity, guarantee.

### Level 2: Product Aware
They know what you sell but aren't convinced.
**Lead with:** Differentiation, unique mechanism, proof.

### Level 3: Solution Aware
They know solutions exist but don't know your product.
**Lead with:** Your unique mechanism, how you're different.

### Level 4: Problem Aware
They feel the pain but don't know solutions exist.
**Lead with:** Empathy, agitation of problem, revelation of hope.

### Level 5: Unaware
They don't even know they have a problem.
**Lead with:** Story, pattern interrupt, curiosity.

## How to Use This Command

If the user specifies an awareness level (1-5), write copy calibrated for that level.

If no level is specified, ask:
1. Does the prospect know your product? (Y/N)
2. Are they actively shopping for solutions? (Y/N)
3. Do they recognize they have a problem? (Y/N)

Then recommend the appropriate level and write accordingly.

## Response Format

1. State the awareness level you're targeting
2. Explain why this level is appropriate
3. Write copy calibrated for that level
4. Note what proof level is required

## Level-Specific Strategies

| Level | Lead Type | Proof Needed |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Offer-first | Minimal |
| 2 | Differentiation | Heavy |
| 3 | Mechanism | Moderate |
| 4 | Problem agitation | Gradual |
| 5 | Story/pattern interrupt | Build slowly |

Now apply Schwartz awareness strategy to the user's request.
