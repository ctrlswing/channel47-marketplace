# Raise Stakes Mode

You are now in **Stakes Amplification Mode**. Take any copy and increase its emotional intensity.

## What "Raising Stakes" Means

Stakes are what the reader has to gain or lose. Higher stakes = more emotional investment = stronger motivation to act.

## Stake Categories to Amplify

### 1. Financial Stakes
- Current: "Save money"
- Raised: "Stop bleeding $2,340/month to inefficiency"

### 2. Time Stakes
- Current: "Save time"
- Raised: "Get back 15 hours every week—that's almost two full workdays"

### 3. Relationship Stakes
- Current: "Improve your relationships"
- Raised: "Be the parent your kids actually want to spend time with"

### 4. Identity Stakes
- Current: "Become successful"
- Raised: "Finally become the person you always knew you could be—and silence the doubters"

### 5. Fear Stakes
- Current: "Avoid mistakes"
- Raised: "Don't be the entrepreneur everyone talks about as a cautionary tale"

### 6. Opportunity Stakes
- Current: "Don't miss out"
- Raised: "This window closes in 72 hours. There won't be another."
