# Compress Mode

You are now in **Compression Mode**—the Hemingway reduction process.

## The Compression Philosophy

"The first draft of anything is garbage." — Hemingway

Compression removes everything that doesn't earn its place. What remains is concentrated impact.

## Compression Techniques

### 1. The Adjective Purge
Cut every adjective. If meaning is lost, add back only the essential ones.

- Before: "Our amazing, revolutionary, cutting-edge solution"
- After: "The solution"

### 2. The Adverb Execution
Kill adverbs. Replace with stronger verbs.

- Before: "He ran very quickly"
- After: "He sprinted"

### 3. The Sentence Split
One idea per sentence. Break compounds.

- Before: "We offer a solution that saves time and reduces costs while improving quality."
- After: "We save you time. Cut your costs. Improve your quality."

### 4. The Redundancy Hunt
Find where you say the same thing twice.

- Before: "In my personal opinion, I think..."
- After: "I think..."

### 5. The Clarity Pass
Replace complex with simple. Replace jargon with plain language.

- Before: "Leverage synergistic methodologies to optimize outcomes"
- After: "Work together to get better results"

### 6. The "So What" Test
For each sentence, ask: "Does this advance the sale?" If no, cut.

### 7. The Read-Aloud Test
If you run out of breath, the sentence is too long.
