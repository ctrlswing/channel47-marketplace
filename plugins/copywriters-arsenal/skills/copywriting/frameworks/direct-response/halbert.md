# Gary Halbert: The A-Pile & Conversational Urgency

## The Essence

Gary Halbert wrote like he was talking to his best friend about something important. No corporate speak. No polish. Raw, urgent, personal. His "Boron Letters" taught a generation that copy should feel like a letter from someone who gives a damn.

## Core Principles

### 1. The A-Pile Concept
Every day, people sort their mail into two piles:
- **A-Pile**: Personal letters, checks, urgent items—opened immediately
- **B-Pile**: Junk mail, bills, promotions—opened maybe, usually trashed

Your goal: GET IN THE A-PILE.

**How to Get in the A-Pile:**
- Hand-addressed envelopes (or digital equivalent)
- Personal subject lines ("Quick question for you")
- No corporate formatting
- Feels like it's FROM someone, not a company

**Email Subject Line Examples:**
- "hey, got a minute?"
- "was thinking about you"
- "this worked for me"
- "quick favor"

### 2. Write to One Person
Halbert never wrote to an audience. He wrote to one specific person. Find your Gary (his was often Gary Jr.) and write directly to them.

**In Practice:**
- Use "you" constantly
- Avoid "customers," "clients," "users"—they're people
- Write like you're sending a personal email
- Imagine them reading it. What would make them stop deleting?

**Before (Corporate):**
"Our customers have experienced significant improvements in their business outcomes through implementation of our solution."

**After (Halbert):**
"Look, here's what happened to Mike. Same situation as you—overworked, underpaid, wondering if there was another way. Three months later? Different guy entirely."

### 3. Conversational Urgency
Halbert's copy felt urgent because HE felt urgent. He wasn't writing marketing copy—he was sharing something important with a friend who needed to hear it.

**In Practice:**
- Write fast, edit slow
- Keep the emotional heat
- Use incomplete sentences if that's how you'd talk
- Interruptions, tangents, asides—like real conversation

**Example:**
"Wait. Before I tell you what happened next, you need to understand something. This wasn't luck. I'm not a lucky person. Ask anyone who knows me. This worked because..."

### 4. The Personal Story Lead
Halbert often opened with a story—usually his own. Real experiences, real lessons. This builds trust faster than any claim.

**In Practice:**
- Start with "Let me tell you what happened..."
- Include specific details (names, places, dates)
- Show vulnerability and mistakes
- Connect YOUR story to THEIR situation

**Example:**
"In 1983, I was broke. I don't mean 'kind of struggling'—I mean eating canned beans, dodging phone calls from creditors broke. Then I discovered something that changed everything. And I'm going to share it with you, because I think you might be in a similar spot."

### 5. The Sales Detective
Before writing a word, Halbert researched obsessively. He called it being a "sales detective." Know your prospect better than they know themselves.

**Research Questions:**
- What keeps them up at 3am?
- What have they tried that failed?
- Who are they trying to impress?
- What secret shame do they carry?
- What would they never admit to friends?

### 6. Emotional Truth First
Halbert believed people buy on emotion and justify with logic. Lead with the emotional hit, then provide logical scaffolding.

**Structure:**
1. Emotional hook (story, pain point, desire)
2. Logical support (proof, mechanism, data)
3. Emotional close (vision of the future, fear of missing out)

## The Halbert Letter Template

```
[GRAB ATTENTION]
Personal greeting. Direct address. Pattern interrupt.

[TELL A STORY]
Your story or a customer's story.
Real details. Vulnerability. Lesson learned.

[CONNECT TO THEM]
"And here's why I'm telling you this..."
Bridge your story to their situation.

[REVEAL THE SOLUTION]
What you discovered.
How it works (conversationally, not technically).

[PROVE IT]
Testimonials, results, evidence.
But keep it conversational—not a proof stack.

[MAKE THE OFFER]
Clear, direct, urgent.
What they get, what they pay, why now.

[REMOVE RISK]
Guarantee that's stronger than they expect.
Take all the risk on yourself.

[CALL TO ACTION]
Specific action. One action.
Urgency without being sleazy.

[P.S.]
Restate the big promise or add urgency.
Halbert's P.S. sections were legendary.

## Halbert's Writing Rules

1. **Write like you talk.** If you wouldn't say it out loud, don't write it.

2. **Use short sentences.** And fragments. Like this.

3. **One idea per paragraph.** White space is your friend.

4. **Start with "you" or a story.** Never start with your company name.

5. **Avoid jargon.** If your grandmother wouldn't understand it, rewrite it.

6. **Read it out loud.** If you stumble, your reader will too.

7. **Use emotion-loaded words.** Not "good results"—"life-changing breakthrough."

8. **End with a P.S.** It's the second-most-read part of any letter.

## Before/After Examples

**Before (Corporate):**
"Welcome to our newsletter. We at Acme Corp are pleased to announce the launch of our new productivity suite, designed to help businesses optimize their workflow efficiency."

**After (Halbert):**
"Hey,

Quick story: Last Tuesday, I was drowning. Inbox at 847 unread, three projects past deadline, and my team looking at me like I had answers I definitely didn't have.

Then I tried something stupid. Something so simple I almost didn't bother.

It worked. And I need to tell you about it, because I have a feeling you've had a few Tuesdays like mine."

---

**Before (Feature-focused):**
"Our software includes project management, time tracking, team collaboration, and file sharing capabilities."

**After (Halbert):**
"Here's what actually matters: Can you go home on Friday knowing nothing's going to blow up over the weekend?

That's the whole point of this thing. Not the features. Not the fancy dashboard. Just the quiet peace of knowing everything's handled."

## The P.S. Formula

Halbert's P.S. sections often sold harder than the body copy. Use them for:

1. **Restating the main benefit**
   - "P.S. Remember, this is the same system that took Mike from $3k months to $30k months in just 90 days."

2. **Adding urgency**
   - "P.S. This offer expires Friday at midnight. After that, the price goes up permanently."

3. **Handling the last objection**
   - "P.S. Still not sure? Remember, you're covered by our 60-day money-back guarantee. Zero risk."

4. **Adding a bonus**
   - "P.S. Order today and I'll throw in my personal swipe file—47 ads that have generated over $10M in sales."

## The Halbert Test

Read your copy and ask:
1. Would I send this to a friend?
2. Does it sound like a person wrote it?
3. Would someone read this aloud without cringing?
4. Is there a story that hooks the reader?
5. Is the P.S. compelling enough to make someone scroll back up?

If any answer is no, rewrite.
