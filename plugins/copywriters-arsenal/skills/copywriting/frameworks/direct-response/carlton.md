# John Carlton: Voice, Sales Detective & No-BS Copy

## The Essence

John Carlton is the copywriter's copywriter—irreverent, deeply skilled, and obsessed with understanding the prospect's inner world. His approach: dig into the psychology until you know what keeps them up at night, then speak to that truth in a voice so real they can't ignore it.

## Core Principles

### 1. Be the Sales Detective
Carlton's process starts with obsessive research—not about the product, but about the PERSON who buys it.

**The Sales Detective Questions:**
- What do they secretly believe about themselves?
- What have they tried that failed? Why do they think it failed?
- What would they never admit to their spouse?
- What do they daydream about when bored at work?
- What's the emotion they're chasing (or running from)?
- Who are they trying to impress? Who are they afraid of disappointing?

**The "3am Question":**
What specific thought wakes them up at 3am? Not "they worry about money"—what EXACTLY do they think?

Example: "Did I make a mistake leaving my job? What if the business fails and I have to explain to my father-in-law that I blew through our savings on a 'dream'?"

THAT'S the hook.

### 2. Find Your Voice
Carlton sounds like Carlton—no one else. Your copy needs a distinctive voice that's authentically yours (or authentically your client's brand).

**Voice Development:**
- Who is doing the talking? Give them a personality.
- What's their attitude toward the subject?
- How would they explain this at a bar?
- What slang, phrases, or quirks do they have?

**Voice Exercise:**
Write the same paragraph in three voices:
1. Excited enthusiast
2. Skeptical expert
3. Been-there-done-that veteran

One will feel right. Use that one.

### 3. The Hook Is Everything
Carlton's hooks are legendary—strange, specific, impossible to ignore.

**The One-Legged Golfer:**
His most famous ad helped create the template for "unusual specificity" in headlines.

**Hook Principles:**
- Specificity beats generality (always)
- Unusual details create curiosity
- Real stories beat made-up ones
- The best hooks seem impossible

**Examples:**
- "How a One-Legged Golfer Beat All His Buddies..." (specific, unusual, curious)
- "The Lazy Man's Way to Riches" (specific type, counterintuitive)
- "What Never to Say to a Cop" (specific situation, forbidden knowledge)

### 4. Enter the Conversation Already Happening
Don't start a new conversation. Join the one already in their head.

**In Practice:**
If they're thinking about their failures, don't open with your product. Open with their failures.

**Example:**
"You've tried everything, haven't you? The courses that promised transformation. The coaches who charged a fortune. The apps, the systems, the hacks. And here you are, still spinning your wheels.

Here's what nobody told you..."

### 5. Be Willing to Offend
Carlton's copy isn't for everyone—and that's the point. Strong voice repels some and attracts others deeply.

**The Repulsion Strategy:**
- Clearly identify who this ISN'T for
- Use language that signals tribal membership
- Take stances that might be controversial
- Let some people self-select out

**Example:**
"If you're looking for another 'feel good' course that pats you on the head and tells you to 'manifest your dreams,' close this page now. This is for people who actually want to do the work."

### 6. The Ruthless Edit
Carlton writes long, then cuts ruthlessly. Every word must fight for its life.

**Editing Questions:**
- Does this advance the sale?
- Would the reader miss it if I cut it?
- Is there a simpler way to say this?
- Am I saying the same thing twice?

## The Carlton Hook Template

```
[PATTERN INTERRUPT]
Something that makes them stop scrolling.
Strange, specific, unexpected.

[EMPATHY HOOK]
Show you understand their world.
Join the conversation in their head.

[CURIOSITY BUILD]
Hint at the solution without revealing it.
Create an information gap.

[CREDIBILITY DROP]
Quick proof you're worth listening to.
Story-based, not braggy.

[THE REVEAL]
What you discovered.
The thing that changes everything.
```

## Carlton's "Rant" Technique

Sometimes the best copy sounds like a rant—passionate, heated, personal. Carlton used controlled rants to build emotional intensity.

**Structure of a Rant:**
1. State the problem (with frustration)
2. Show you're on their side
3. Attack the common enemy (bad advice, gatekeepers, etc.)
4. Reveal what actually works
5. Channel the energy into action

**Example:**
"I'm sick of watching good people get burned by gurus. These people—and you know exactly who I mean—they charge $10,000 for 'mastermind' programs that teach you to... what? 'Believe in yourself'? Please.

Here's what actually moves the needle..."

## The "One Right Person" Technique

Carlton writes to ONE specific person. Not a demographic. A specific human being.

**How to Create Your One Person:**
- Give them a name
- Know their age, job, family situation
- Know their last three failures
- Know what they'd never tell anyone
- Know what they're secretly proud of

Then write every word to THAT person.

## Before/After Examples

**Before (Generic):**
"Learn the secrets of successful entrepreneurs and build the business of your dreams."

**After (Carlton Voice):**
"Look, I wasn't born knowing this stuff. I was the guy reading business books on my lunch break while my coworkers planned their weekends. I was the guy staying up until 2am trying to figure out what I was missing. And I was broke for years.

Then I met a guy at a conference—he was barely listening to the speaker, just scribbling on a napkin. I asked what he was writing. 'The actual formula,' he said. 'Not the stuff they tell you from stage.'

That napkin changed everything."

---

**Before (Feature-focused):**
"Our software has an intuitive dashboard with real-time analytics."

**After (Carlton Voice):**
"Forget the dashboard for a minute. Here's what matters: Can you look at one screen—ONE—and know exactly whether you're having a good day or a bad day? Not click through five tabs. Not download a report. Just glance and know.

That's what this does. Everything else is window dressing."

## Carlton's Copy Rules

1. **The best copy sounds like how you talk when you're NOT trying to sell.**

2. **Specificity is the soul of credibility.** Never be vague.

3. **Confusion is the enemy.** If they have to think, you've lost.

4. **Find the wound.** Prospects act from pain more than desire.

5. **Your personality is your competitive advantage.** No one can copy YOU.

6. **Read it out loud.** If it doesn't flow, rewrite it.

## The Carlton Test

Before submitting:
1. ☐ Would my target reader stop scrolling?
2. ☐ Is there a distinctive voice—not corporate speak?
3. ☐ Did I join the conversation already in their head?
4. ☐ Is there specific, unusual detail in the hook?
5. ☐ Would someone who isn't right for this self-select out?
6. ☐ Does it sound like a person who gives a damn?

If any answer is no, dig deeper.
