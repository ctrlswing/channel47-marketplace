# Joe Sugarman: The Slippery Slide & Psychological Triggers

## The Essence

Joe Sugarman was the master of making copy impossible to stop reading. His "slippery slide" concept changed how we think about copy structure: every element exists for one purpose—to get you to read the next element. Plus, he identified the psychological triggers that make people buy.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Slippery Slide
"Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slide."

**Every Element's Job:**
- Headline's job → Get them to read the subheadline
- Subheadline's job → Get them to read the first paragraph
- First paragraph's job → Get them to read the second
- And so on...

If any element doesn't compel forward motion, rewrite it.

**Slippery Slide Techniques:**
- Short paragraphs (eyes keep moving)
- Open loops (unresolved curiosity)
- Bucket brigades (transitional phrases)
- Momentum through specificity

### 2. The First Sentence Rule
"The sole purpose of the first sentence in an advertisement is to get you to read the second sentence."

This means the first sentence should be:
- Short (never more than 10 words)
- Easy to read
- Compelling enough to continue

**Examples:**
- "It was a disaster."
- "Three months ago, I was broke."
- "Pay close attention."
- "This is personal."
- "I need to tell you something."

### 3. Bucket Brigades
These transitional phrases keep readers sliding down:

**Classic Bucket Brigades:**
- "But that's not all..."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "And the best part?"
- "Now, here's where it gets interesting..."
- "But wait..."
- "The result?"
- "Think about it..."
- "Here's why this matters..."
- "So what happened next?"
- "Bottom line:"

Use them between paragraphs to maintain momentum.

### 4. Curiosity Seeds
Create small open loops throughout your copy—questions raised but not immediately answered.

**In Practice:**
"There's one more thing I haven't told you yet. But first, let me explain how I discovered this..."

The reader must continue to close the loop.

## The 24 Psychological Triggers

Sugarman identified specific triggers that compel action:

### 1. Feeling of Involvement
Make them participate mentally. Ask questions. Use "you."

### 2. Honesty
Admit flaws. Acknowledge downsides. Builds massive trust.

### 3. Integrity
Back up every claim. Do what you say. Be consistent.

### 4. Credibility
Stack proof. Use specifics. Cite sources.

### 5. Value and Proof of Value
Show ROI clearly. Compare to alternatives.

### 6. Justify the Purchase
Give logical reasons to support emotional decision.

### 7. Greed
"Get more than you give" appeals to everyone.

### 8. Establish Authority
Position yourself as the expert. Share credentials.

### 9. Satisfaction Conviction
"You will be satisfied—guaranteed."

### 10. Nature of Product
Physical products need sensory description.

### 11. Current Fads
Tie to trends when appropriate.

### 12. Timing
Right message, right moment.

### 13. Linking
Associate product with something they already love/trust.

### 14. Consistency
People want to be consistent with past behavior.

### 15. Harmonize
Agree with their existing beliefs. Don't fight them.

### 16. Desire to Belong
Tap into tribal instincts.

### 17. Desire to Collect
People love completing sets.

### 18. Curiosity
The most powerful trigger. Create information gaps.

### 19. Sense of Urgency
Limited time, limited quantity, rising prices.

### 20. Fear
What happens if they DON'T act?

### 21. Instant Gratification
How quickly will they experience the benefit?

### 22. Exclusivity
"Not for everyone."

### 23. Simplicity
Make the buying process easy.

### 24. Human Relationships
People buy from people they like.

## Applying the Triggers

For each piece of copy, choose 5-7 triggers that fit:

| Copy Type | Primary Triggers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Sales page | Curiosity, Value, Urgency, Proof, Authority |
| Email | Curiosity, Involvement, Honesty, Simplicity |
| Landing page | Instant Gratification, Value, Simplicity, Urgency |
| Testimonial request | Consistency, Belonging, Human Relationships |
| Upsell | Greed, Desire to Collect, Instant Gratification |

## The Sugarman Opening Template

```
[SHORT FIRST SENTENCE]
5-10 words maximum. Create intrigue.

[EXPAND SLIGHTLY]
One or two more short sentences.
Build the hook.

[BUCKET BRIGADE]
"Here's what happened..."

[STORY OR FACT]
Something concrete that justifies their attention.

[CURIOSITY SEED]
Hint at something you'll reveal later.

[CONTINUE DOWN THE SLIDE...]
```

## Before/After Examples

**Before (Wall of Text):**
"Welcome to our website. We are a leading provider of software solutions for businesses of all sizes. Our team of experienced developers has spent years creating a platform that we believe will revolutionize the way you manage your operations. We offer a wide range of features including project management, time tracking, and team collaboration tools."

**After (Slippery Slide):**
"Something happened last Tuesday.

My biggest client—the one responsible for 40% of my revenue—emailed at 11pm.

The subject line? 'We need to talk.'

I'll tell you what happened in a minute. But first, let me ask you something:

When was the last time an email like that made you feel... excited? Instead of terrified?

Because that's what this is about."

---

**Before (Long opening):**
"In today's fast-paced business environment, entrepreneurs face unprecedented challenges in managing their growing operations while maintaining work-life balance."

**After (Short opening):**
"I was working 80 hours a week.

Then I wasn't.

Here's what changed."

## The Momentum Matrix

How to maintain slippery slide momentum:

| Paragraph # | Length | Function |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | 1-2 sentences | Hook |
| 2 | 2-3 sentences | Expand hook |
| 3 | 3-4 sentences | Bridge to story |
| 4-6 | Varies | Story development |
| 7 | Short | Bucket brigade break |
| 8-10 | Varies | Mechanism/proof |
| 11 | Short | Another bucket brigade |
| 12+ | Varies | Offer development |

Never let three long paragraphs stack without a break.

## Sugarman's Rules for Copy

1. **All elements exist to get you to read the first sentence.**

2. **Every sentence must compel the next.**

3. **Create an environment of buying.** Make them feel like buyers, not browsers.

4. **Resonate with the reader.** Match their beliefs.

5. **Selling is education.** The more they learn, the more they buy.

6. **Price is not most important.** Value perception is.

7. **Tell the truth.** It's the most powerful trigger.

## The Sugarman Test

Before publishing:
1. ☐ Is the first sentence under 10 words?
2. ☐ Does each element compel the next?
3. ☐ Are there bucket brigades every 3-4 paragraphs?
4. ☐ Have I used at least 5 psychological triggers?
5. ☐ Are there open loops creating curiosity?
6. ☐ Would someone read this without stopping?

If any answer is no, add more slide grease.
