# David Ogilvy: Research-Backed Copy & Elegant Proof

## The Essence

"The consumer isn't a moron; she is your wife." Ogilvy believed in respecting the reader's intelligence while building an unassailable case through research, proof, and elegance. His copy informed before it persuaded—and in doing so, persuaded more effectively.

## Core Principles

### 1. Research Is Everything
Ogilvy spent weeks researching before writing a single headline. He said, "Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."

**Research Checklist:**
- ☐ What does the product actually do?
- ☐ What makes it genuinely different?
- ☐ What do current customers say about it?
- ☐ What has the competition claimed?
- ☐ What can be proven, not just claimed?
- ☐ What is the one thing that matters most?

**The Big Idea Hunt:**
Research until you find "the big idea"—the one insight that will make your campaign unforgettable.

### 2. The Headline Is 80%
"On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."

**Ogilvy's Headline Rules:**
- Include the benefit in the headline
- Use news when you have it
- Avoid blind headlines that say nothing
- Longer headlines often outperform shorter ones
- Put your key words first
- Be specific, not vague

**His Most Famous:**
"At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock."

Why it works: Specific, surprising, implies quality without claiming it.

### 3. Facts Over Adjectives
Ogilvy trusted facts over claims. Specific facts are more believable than generic assertions.

**Before (Adjectives):**
"Our product is revolutionary, amazing, and the best in class."

**After (Facts):**
"Used by 37,000 engineers at companies including NASA, SpaceX, and Ford. Error rate: 0.003%."

**The Fact Stack:**
Layer specific facts to build credibility:
- Numbers: "Reduces processing time by 47%"
- Social proof: "Adopted by 12 Fortune 500 companies"
- Authority: "Recommended by the American Medical Association"
- Heritage: "Refined over 23 years of development"

### 4. Long Copy Sells
Ogilvy proved that long copy outperforms short copy—IF every word earns its place.

"The more you tell, the more you sell."

**When Long Copy Works:**
- Complex products requiring explanation
- High-consideration purchases
- Products with genuine differentiation
- Audiences actively seeking information

**Long Copy Rules:**
- Every paragraph must add value
- Break up text visually
- Use subheads as a second story
- Reward readers who go deep

### 5. Brand Image is Asset
Ogilvy pioneered "brand image"—the idea that every ad should contribute to the long-term personality of the brand.

**In Practice:**
- Be consistent across all communications
- Never sacrifice brand image for a quick sale
- Define the brand personality and stick to it
- Quality of communication reflects quality of product

### 6. Tell the Truth
"The customer is not a moron. She is your wife. You insult her intelligence if you assume that a mere slogan and a few vapid adjectives will persuade her to buy anything."

**Truth-Telling in Copy:**
- Never claim what you can't prove
- Acknowledge weaknesses (they increase credibility)
- Let the reader draw conclusions from evidence
- Respect their intelligence

## The Ogilvy Proof Hierarchy

Stack proof from least to most powerful:

| Level | Proof Type | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Claims | "We're the best" |
| 2 | Specifications | "Runs at 3.2 GHz with 99.9% uptime" |
| 3 | Demonstrations | "Watch this video of the product in action" |
| 4 | Testimonials | "Here's what customers say..." |
| 5 | Case Studies | "Here's exactly what happened with Client X" |
| 6 | Statistics | "4,847 businesses use this daily" |
| 7 | Third-Party Endorsement | "Recommended by [Authority]" |
| 8 | Risk Reversal | "Money-back guarantee" |
| 9 | Physical Evidence | "See the before/after photos" |

Level 1 is weakest. Level 9 is strongest. Stack multiple levels.

## Ogilvy's Copy Rules

1. **Never write an ad you wouldn't want your family to read.**

2. **If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative.**

3. **The more informative your advertising, the more persuasive it will be.**

4. **Good advertising is education.** People want to learn.

5. **Tell the truth.** But make it fascinating.

6. **Be specific.** Vague claims are ignored.

7. **Use captions.** They're read more than body copy.

8. **Avoid superlatives.** They telegraph advertising.

## Before/After Examples

**Before (Hype):**
"Introducing the world's most revolutionary productivity app! You'll be amazed at how much more you can accomplish with our cutting-edge technology!"

**After (Ogilvy):**
"127,000 hours of work saved last year. That's what our users reported in our annual survey. Here's how they did it—and how you can too."

---

**Before (Feature list):**
"Our software includes: project management, time tracking, invoicing, team chat, and file storage."

**After (Ogilvy):**
"When we surveyed 1,000 freelancers, we asked one question: What wastes most of your time? The top five answers became the five core features of this tool. Each one was refined through 18 months of testing until the average user saved 7.3 hours per week. Here's the research behind each feature:"

## The Elegant Objection Handle

Ogilvy addressed objections not by arguing but by presenting counter-evidence.

**Bad:**
"You might think our product is expensive, but you're wrong!"

**Ogilvy:**
"At $299, this isn't the cheapest option. It's also not the most expensive. What it is: the option with the lowest total cost of ownership over three years, according to an independent study by [Research Firm]."

## The Ogilvy Test

Before publishing, verify:
1. ☐ Is the headline benefit-driven and specific?
2. ☐ Can every claim be proven?
3. ☐ Would an intelligent reader find this informative?
4. ☐ Have I stacked at least 3 types of proof?
5. ☐ Does this build the brand's long-term image?
6. ☐ Would I be proud to show this to my wife?

If any answer is no, revise.
