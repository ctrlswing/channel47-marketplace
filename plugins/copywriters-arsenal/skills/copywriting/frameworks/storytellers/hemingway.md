# Hemingway Mode: The Iceberg Theory of Copy

## The Essence

Hemingway believed that the dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. What you leave out creates more power than what you include. In copywriting, restraint is strength. Economy is elegance.

## Core Principles

### 1. Omission is Strength
What you leave out creates tension. The reader fills gaps with their own imagination—which is always more powerful than anything you could write.

**In Practice:**
- Cut every word that doesn't earn its place
- Trust the reader to connect dots
- Let silence do heavy lifting

**Example:**
> "She tried the diet. Then another. Then another. She stopped counting at twelve. The scale never moved. Until it did."

### 2. Short Sentences. Short Words.
When you hit, hit hard. Long sentences diffuse impact. Short sentences concentrate it.

**In Practice:**
- One idea per sentence
- Vary rhythm, but default to brevity
- Save long sentences for rest, not emphasis

**Example:**
> "It works. That's all you need to know. But here's what makes it work..."

### 3. Concrete Nouns. Active Verbs.
No adjective does the work of the right noun. No adverb saves a weak verb. Find the exact word.

**In Practice:**
- "Car" → "Mustang"
- "Ran quickly" → "Sprinted"
- "Very tired" → "Exhausted"

**Example:**
Before: "He was extremely successful in business"
After: "He built an empire"

### 4. One Idea Per Sentence
Let each thought land before the next arrives. Stacking ideas dilutes all of them.

**In Practice:**
- Break compound sentences
- Give key points their own line
- Use white space as punctuation

### 5. The Unsaid Haunts
The most important thing often goes unstated. Readers sense it. That's what makes them lean in.

**In Practice:**
- Imply the big promise
- Let testimonials speak the unspeakable
- End with resonance, not explanation

## The Hemingway Edit Process

1. **Write it long first** - Get everything out
2. **Cut every adjective** - If it survives, it's essential
3. **Cut every adverb** - Active verbs don't need them
4. **Find the one sentence** - That says it all
5. **Delete everything that repeats that truth**
6. **What remains is the iceberg tip** - Readers sense the mass below

## When to Deploy Hemingway Mode

- **Markets exhausted by hype** - Restraint stands out
- **Premium products** - Confidence doesn't explain itself
- **Sophisticated audiences** - They resent being sold to
- **Headlines and subject lines** - Every word costs attention
- **CTAs** - Action needs clarity, not persuasion
- **Testimonials** - Edit for impact, keep the truth

## Hemingway for Different Copy Types

### Headlines
Cut until it hurts. Then cut one more word.
- Before: "Discover the Amazing Secret to Losing Weight Fast"
- After: "Finally. It Works."

### Email Subject Lines
Mystery + Brevity = Opens
- Before: "Check out our incredible new product launch!"
- After: "It's ready."

### CTAs
Tell them what to do. Stop.
- Before: "Click Here to Get Started on Your Journey Today!"
- After: "Start Now."

### Testimonials
Find the one line. Use only that.
- Before: Full paragraph of praise
- After: "Changed my life. No exaggeration."

## The Rhythm Rule

Hemingway wasn't monotonous. He varied sentence length for rhythm. A short sentence hits harder after a longer one. Like this.

**Example:**
"They told him the business would fail. They said the market was too crowded, the timing was wrong, the idea was too ambitious. They had data to prove it. He didn't care. He built it anyway. It worked."

## Combining with Other Frameworks

Hemingway provides the **voice and economy**. Layer in:
- **Halbert** for conversational warmth
- **Schwartz** for strategic structure
- **Ogilvy** for proof (but keep it tight)
- **Sugarman** for psychological triggers (compressed)

## The Ultimate Hemingway Test

Read your copy aloud. If you run out of breath, the sentence is too long. If you're bored, so will they be. If it sounds like a brochure, it is one.

The best copy doesn't sound like copy. It sounds like truth.
