# Swipe File Anatomy: How to Deconstruct Great Copy

## What is a Swipe File?

A swipe file is a collection of proven copy that you study and adapt (never steal) for your own work. Every great copywriter maintains one. But having a swipe file isn't enough—you need to know how to ANALYZE what makes each piece work.

## The Deconstruction Framework

When analyzing any piece of copy, examine these 7 layers:

### Layer 1: The Hook

**Questions to Ask:**
- What grabs attention in the first 3 seconds?
- What pattern does it interrupt?
- What promise (implicit or explicit) does it make?
- What emotion does it trigger?

**Elements to Note:**
- [ ] Headline structure
- [ ] First sentence length
- [ ] Visual treatment (if applicable)
- [ ] Curiosity mechanism

**Common Hook Types:**
| Type | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Question | "Still not sleeping through the night?" | Forces mental engagement |
| Story | "In 1976, I was broke..." | Pattern interrupt |
| Challenge | "You're probably doing this wrong" | Ego engagement |
| Specificity | "37% of CEOs make this mistake" | Credibility + curiosity |
| Contrast | "While everyone else zagged, we zigged" | Differentiation |
| News | "New discovery changes everything" | Urgency + novelty |

---

### Layer 2: The Lead

**Questions to Ask:**
- What awareness level is this targeting?
- How long before the product is mentioned?
- What story structure is being used?
- How is empathy established?

**Lead Types by Awareness:**
| Awareness Level | Lead Type | Length |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Most Aware | Offer lead | Short |
| Product Aware | Differentiation lead | Medium |
| Solution Aware | Mechanism lead | Medium-Long |
| Problem Aware | Problem/Story lead | Long |
| Unaware | Story/News lead | Very Long |

**Elements to Note:**
- [ ] How long is the lead section?
- [ ] What's the hook → story transition?
- [ ] Where is the first proof point?
- [ ] When does the product appear?

---

### Layer 3: The Mechanism

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is the unique mechanism being claimed?
- How is it explained?
- What makes it seem new/different?
- Is it named? Branded?

**Mechanism Elements:**
- [ ] What is the unique approach/method/technology?
- [ ] How is it differentiated from competitors?
- [ ] Is there a proprietary name?
- [ ] How is it made credible?

**Strong Mechanism Formula:**
```
[Unexpected source] + [Specific process] + [Believable result]
= Compelling mechanism

Example: "The monk's method" + "3-minute morning ritual" + "2x productivity"
```

---

### Layer 4: The Proof Stack

**Questions to Ask:**
- What types of proof are used?
- In what order are they presented?
- How specific is each proof point?
- What's the proof-to-claim ratio?

**Proof Hierarchy (Weakest to Strongest):**
1. Claims/Assertions
2. Explanations
3. Demonstrations
4. Testimonials (unspecific)
5. Testimonials (specific with details)
6. Case studies
7. Statistics/Data
8. Third-party endorsements
9. Celebrity/Authority endorsements
10. Physical evidence/Before-after

**Elements to Note:**
- [ ] Count proof points
- [ ] Categorize by type
- [ ] Note specificity level
- [ ] Map placement in copy

---

### Layer 5: The Objection Handling

**Questions to Ask:**
- What objections are addressed?
- How early/late are they handled?
- Are they stated explicitly or addressed implicitly?
- What technique is used to handle each?

**Common Objection Categories:**
| Category | Example Objection | Handling Technique |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Price | "Too expensive" | ROI comparison, payment plan, reason why |
| Time | "Don't have time" | Ease of use, quick wins |
| Trust | "Sounds too good" | Proof stack, guarantee |
| Fit | "Not for me" | Testimonials from similar people |
| Timing | "Not right now" | Urgency, cost of waiting |
| Competition | "Others are cheaper" | Differentiation, hidden costs |

**Elements to Note:**
- [ ] List objections addressed
- [ ] Map where in copy they appear
- [ ] Note if proactive or reactive
- [ ] Evaluate handling effectiveness

---

### Layer 6: The Offer Architecture

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is actually being offered?
- How is it packaged/presented?
- What's the value stack?
- How is price justified?

**Offer Elements:**
- [ ] Core product/service
- [ ] Bonuses (and their perceived value)
- [ ] Guarantee structure
- [ ] Payment options
- [ ] Scarcity/urgency elements
- [ ] Risk reversal language

**Offer Presentation Techniques:**
```
VALUE STACK TEMPLATE:
"You get [Main thing].............$XXX value
Plus [Bonus 1]...................$XXX value
Plus [Bonus 2]...................$XXX value
Total value.....................$X,XXX
Your price today................$XXX"
```

---

### Layer 7: The Close & CTA

**Questions to Ask:**
- How is urgency created?
- What action is requested?
- How clear is the CTA?
- What happens in the P.S.?

**CTA Elements:**
- [ ] Action verb used
- [ ] Benefit restated in CTA?
- [ ] Visual treatment of button/link
- [ ] Friction reducers (e.g., "takes 60 seconds")
- [ ] Post-CTA reassurance

**P.S. Analysis:**
The P.S. is often the second-most-read element. Note:
- [ ] What does the P.S. contain?
- [ ] Does it restate the main benefit?
- [ ] Does it add urgency?
- [ ] Does it add a new hook?

## The Golden Rule

**Swipe the STRUCTURE, not the WORDS.**

When you find great copy:
1. Identify WHY it works (structure, psychology, timing)
2. Extract the principle
3. Apply that principle to your unique situation
4. Never copy word-for-word

The goal is understanding, not theft.
