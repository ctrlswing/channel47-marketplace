## The 7 Core Emotional Drivers

### 1. Fear

**The Trigger:** Fear of loss, danger, exclusion, or failure.

**Why It Works:** Fear is the most powerful motivator. Loss aversion is 2x stronger than gain-seeking.

**Manifestations:**
- Fear of missing out (FOMO)
- Fear of failure
- Fear of looking foolish
- Fear of being left behind
- Fear of loss (money, status, relationships)
- Fear of pain/discomfort

**Copy Activation:**
```
- "What happens if you DON'T [take action]?"
- "While you wait, your competitors are..."
- "Every day without this, you're losing..."
- "The hidden danger of [current approach]..."
- "Warning: [Consequence of inaction]"
```

**Example:**
"Every month you wait, you're losing an average of $2,340 to inefficient processes. That's not a guess—it's what our analysis found across 500 businesses like yours."

**Caution:** Fear must be followed by hope/solution. Pure fear without relief creates paralysis, not action.

### 2. Greed

**The Trigger:** Desire for more—money, status, possessions, opportunities.

**Why It Works:** The promise of gain is universally motivating. "More for less" is irresistible.

**Manifestations:**
- Financial gain
- Getting more value
- Exclusive access
- Saving money/time
- Having what others don't

**Copy Activation:**
```
- "Get [valuable thing] for [low price]"
- "The same system millionaires use..."
- "How to get twice the results in half the time"
- "Exclusive access to..."
- "Before it goes public..."
```

**Example:**
"For the next 72 hours, you can access the same research tools hedge funds pay $50,000/year for—for just $49/month."

**Caution:** Greed without credibility triggers skepticism. Always pair with proof.

---

### 3. Pride/Vanity

**The Trigger:** Desire to be admired, respected, or seen as superior.

**Why It Works:** Social status is a primal need. We care deeply about how others perceive us.

**Manifestations:**
- Looking successful
- Being admired by peers
- Proving doubters wrong
- Standing out from the crowd
- Being seen as smart/capable

**Copy Activation:**
```
- "Imagine the look on their faces when..."
- "Join the [elite group] who..."
- "Be the one everyone asks for advice"
- "Finally get the recognition you deserve"
- "Show them what you're capable of"
```

**Example:**
"When you walk into the meeting with these insights, you won't just be prepared—you'll be the smartest person in the room. And everyone will know it."

**Hidden Benefit Angle:** Often, the hidden benefit behind a purchase is the identity it confers. Dig for this.

### 4. Lust

**The Trigger:** Desire for pleasure, beauty, sensory experience, or attraction.

**Why It Works:** Pleasure-seeking is hardwired. Goes beyond sex—includes all sensory desires.

**Manifestations:**
- Physical attraction
- Sensory pleasure (taste, touch, comfort)
- Aesthetic beauty
- Luxury and indulgence
- "Treating yourself"

**Copy Activation:**
```
- "Indulge in..."
- "You deserve..."
- "Feel the difference..."
- "Experience the luxury of..."
- "Imagine waking up to..."
```

**Example:**
"The moment you sink into the chair, you'll feel it—that perfect combination of support and softness. This isn't just comfort. This is what you've been missing."

**Application:** Even B2B has lust—the lust for a sleek interface, a smooth process, an elegant solution.

---

### 5. Envy

**The Trigger:** Desire for what others have.

**Why It Works:** Social comparison is constant. Seeing others succeed creates motivation.

**Manifestations:**
- Wanting what competitors have
- Keeping up with peers
- Achieving what others have achieved
- Not being left behind
- Having what the "in-group" has

**Copy Activation:**
```
- "Your competitors are already using this..."
- "Why [successful type] always seem to..."
- "The tool [successful person] swears by..."
- "What [successful group] knows that you don't..."
- "Stop watching others succeed from the sidelines"
```

**Example:**
"When you see someone crushing it in your industry, chances are they've discovered what I'm about to share. It's not luck. It's a system—and now it's yours."

**Best Practice:** Envy works best when the reference is a slight stretch—aspirational but achievable.

### 6. Sloth/Ease

**The Trigger:** Desire to avoid effort, pain, or difficulty.

**Why It Works:** Humans are efficiency machines. We want maximum results with minimum effort.

**Manifestations:**
- Easy implementation
- Done-for-you solutions
- Automation and delegation
- Shortcuts and hacks
- "Set it and forget it"

**Copy Activation:**
```
- "The lazy way to..."
- "Done for you..."
- "Works while you sleep..."
- "Set up in 5 minutes, runs forever..."
- "No learning curve required..."
```

**Example:**
"Once you click 'activate,' the system handles everything. Lead capture, follow-up emails, appointment booking—all automated. You just show up for the calls."

**Caution:** Balance ease with credibility. "Too easy" triggers disbelief. Add mechanism for believability.

---

### 7. Curiosity

**The Trigger:** The need to close an information gap.

**Why It Works:** Unresolved questions create mental tension. We're compelled to resolve them.

**Manifestations:**
- What happens next?
- What's the secret?
- What do they know that I don't?
- How did they do it?
- What's behind the curtain?

**Copy Activation:**
```
- "The surprising reason..."
- "What [authority] won't tell you..."
- "The little-known secret..."
- "Here's what happened next..."
- [Open a loop, don't close it immediately]
```

**Example:**
"There's one thing every successful founder does in their first year—and it's not what you'd expect. In fact, when I tell you, you might think I'm joking. But here's the data..."

**Technique:** Open loops create forward momentum. Use throughout copy, not just headlines.
