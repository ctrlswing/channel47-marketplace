# Getting Started with The Copywriter's Arsenal

This guide will help you start writing better copy immediately.

## Step 1: Understand the Two Lineages

Before diving into the tools, understand the philosophy:

### Storytellers (How to make them FEEL)
| Master | Superpower | Best For |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Homer | Epic transformation | Long-form, high-ticket |
| Hemingway | Economy, restraint | Headlines, premium brands |
| Dickens | Vivid sensory detail | Case studies, testimonials |
| Chekhov | Subtext, implication | Sophisticated audiences |
| Campbell | Hero's journey | Sales pages, VSLs |

### Direct Response (How to make them ACT)
| Master | Superpower | Best For |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Schwartz | Awareness matching | All copy (foundation) |
| Halbert | Conversational urgency | Emails, letters |
| Ogilvy | Research-backed proof | B2B, high consideration |
| Carlton | Voice, personality | Brand differentiation |
| Sugarman | Psychological triggers | Ads, landing pages |
| Bencivenga | Hidden benefits | Premium products |

## Step 2: Learn the Schwartz Foundation

Before writing anything, identify your prospect's awareness level:

1. **Most Aware** — Know your product, ready to buy → Lead with offer
2. **Product Aware** — Know your product, not convinced → Lead with differentiation
3. **Solution Aware** — Know solutions exist, don't know you → Lead with mechanism
4. **Problem Aware** — Feel the pain, don't know solutions → Lead with empathy
5. **Unaware** — Don't know they have a problem → Lead with story

**Pro tip:** Use the `/schwartz` command to calibrate your copy.

## Step 3: Your First Copy Task

Try this workflow:

### For a Landing Page
```
1. "Write a landing page for [product] targeting [audience who is problem-aware]"

2. Claude applies Schwartz + appropriate storyteller framework

3. Use /raise-stakes to amplify if needed

4. Use /add-proof to layer in credibility

5. Use /compress for a tighter version
```

### For Headlines
```
1. "/headline [product] [key benefit]"

2. Review 20+ options across different formulas

3. Pick top 3 for A/B testing
```

### For Email Sequences
```
1. "Create a 5-email welcome sequence for [product]"

2. Claude applies character-driven sequence framework

3. Each email builds on the previous
```

## Step 4: Experiment with Modes

Activate specific modes for different effects:

### Sparse & Powerful
```
/hemingway

Then: "Write a headline for a productivity app"
```

### Conversational & Urgent
```
/halbert

Then: "Write an email to announce a flash sale"
```

### Fused Power
```
/fusion hemingway halbert

Then: "Write copy for a premium course"
```

## Step 5: Analyze and Improve

### Deconstruct Great Copy
```
/swipe

[Paste any copy you admire]
```

You'll get:
- Hook analysis
- Lead type identification
- Proof stack breakdown
- Objection handling review
- Improvement suggestions

### Find Weaknesses
```
/weakness

[Paste your draft copy]
```

You'll get:
- Critical issues to fix
- Objections left unaddressed
- Specific rewrite suggestions

## Step 6: Build Your Swipe File

As you use the plugin, save great examples:

1. Run `/swipe` on copy you admire
2. Note the key insight
3. Save the pattern for reuse

The more you analyze, the better your intuition becomes.

## Recommended Learning Path

### Week 1: Foundation
- Read `frameworks/direct-response/schwartz.md` completely
- Practice identifying awareness levels in ads you see
- Use `/schwartz` on 5 different products

### Week 2: Storytelling
- Read `frameworks/storytellers/hemingway.md`
- Practice compressing existing copy with `/compress`
- Read `frameworks/storytellers/campbell.md`

### Week 3: Integration
- Read 2-3 fusion frameworks
- Practice combining modes with `/fusion`
- Analyze 10 pieces of copy with `/swipe`

### Week 4: Mastery
- Read remaining frameworks
- Use agents for larger projects
- Build your personal swipe file

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Writing Level 1 copy for Level 4 audience**
   Always check awareness first

2. **Over-explaining to believers**
   Match proof to skepticism level

3. **Forgetting the hidden benefit**
   What do they REALLY want?

4. **All story, no structure**
   Combine storyteller emotion with DR architecture

5. **All structure, no soul**
   Don't forget the human element

## Quick Reference Card

```
IDENTIFY → What's their awareness level?
SELECT   → Which framework fits?
FUSE     → What storyteller energy helps?
WRITE    → Apply the structure
ANALYZE  → Check for weaknesses
IMPROVE  → Raise stakes, add proof, compress
```

## Need Help?

- Each framework file has detailed examples
- Use `/swipe` to learn from great copy
- Use `/weakness` to diagnose problems
- Agents can handle complex multi-step tasks

Happy writing!
